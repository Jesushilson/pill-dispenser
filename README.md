# pill-dispenser
Engineering project for Hack-URI where we will build a prototype for a reliable system that will be controlled in real time by a mobile app. The system will consist of 2 cartridges of storage for different types of pills.  The app will act as a controller for the system where it will have how often each pill should be dispensed.
